# Longtracker
Manual cell tracking application. 

Before running Longtracker, you must download the Bio-formats MATLAB toolbox located here: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/
You can combine the Longtracker files with the Bio-formats toolbox into one folder and add the folder to the MATLAB paths. Once the path is set, type longtracker at the MATLAB prompt and it should open.
